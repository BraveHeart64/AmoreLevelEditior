# AmoreLevelEditior
ALLEGRO5 Level Editor.  The Goal is to create a program that allows the user to create maps for computer games. The user can press T to change the platform and use the mouse to place the icon on the 
screen. The program is a bit a ways from compeleting the task. Every day I am getting closer to finishing this project. Remaiing features, the click, game camera and the save function. The menu is an image and must follow the camera and the x and y must be adjusted for the new location to remain functional. After these things are complete then the program will be ready.
